1. RISK JUNKIES
*High risk, high reward: It takes balls of steel to play this game.
—Told to a friend before starting the Turtle program*

2. TAMING THE TURTLE MIND
*Human emotion is both the source of opportunity in trading
and the greatest challenge. Master it and you will succeed.
Ignore it at your peril.*

3. THE FIRST $2 MILLION IS THE TOUGHEST
*Trade with an edge, manage risk, be consistent, and keep it simple.
The entire Turtle training, and indeed the basis for all successful
trading, can be summed up in these four core principles.*

4. THINK LIKE A TURTLE
*Good trading is not about being right, it is about trading right.
If you want to be successful, you need to think of the long run
and ignore the outcomes of individual trades.*

5. TRADING WITH AN EDGE
*Trading with an edge is what separates the professionals from the
amateurs. Ignore this and you will be eaten by those who don’t.*

6. FALLING OFF THE EDGE
*Edges are found in the places that are the battlegrounds
between buyers and sellers. Your task as a trader is to find
those places and wait to see who wins and who loses.*

7. BY WHAT MEASURE?
*Mature understanding of and respect for risk is the
hallmark of the best traders. They know that if you don’t keep
an eye on risk, it will set its eye on you.*

8. RISK AND MONEY MANAGEMENT
*Ruin is the risk you should be concerned with the most.
It can come like a thief in the night and steal everything
if you aren’t watching carefully.*

9.  TURTLE-STYLE BUILDING BLOCKS
*Don’t spend all your time admiring the fancy tools
in the magazines. First learn how to use the basic ones well.
It’s not the size of your tools that counts but how well you use them.*
 

10. TURTLE-STYLE TRADING:STEP BY STEP
*Keep it simple. Simple time-tested methods that are
well executed will beat fancy complicated methods every time.*

11. LIES, DAMN LIES, AND BACKTESTS
*Charlatans and scoundrels lurk in dark corners,
awaiting the unsuspecting. Don’t be their prey.*

12. ON SOLID GROUND
*Trading with poor methods is like learning to juggle while
standing in a rowboat during a storm. Sure, it can be done, but it is
much easier to juggle when one is standing on solid ground.*

13. BULLETPROOF SYSTEMS
*Trading is not a sprint; it’s boxing. The market will beat you up,
screw with your head, and do anything it can to defeat you.
But when the bell sounds at the end of the twelfth round,
you must be standing in the ring in order to win.*

14. MASTERING YOUR DEMONS
*The market does not care how you feel. It will not prop up your ego or
console you when you are down. Therefore, trading is not for everyone.
If you are unwilling to face the truth about the markets and the truth
about your own limitations, fears, and failures, you will not succeed.*


15. WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE
*Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.
—Robert Frost*

16. ORIGINAL TURTLE TRADING RULES
*I always say that you could publish my trading rules in the newspaper
and no one would follow them. The key is consistency and discipline.
Almost anybody can make up a list of rules that are 80% as good as
what we taught our people. What they couldn’t do is give them the
confidence to stick to those rules even when things are going bad.
—Richard Dennis, quoted in Market Wizards by Jack D. Schwager.*
